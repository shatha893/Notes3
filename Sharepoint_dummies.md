## Note:  
The term website and webapplication are often used interchangeably. In the deep, dark technicl world of SharePoint administration, the term *web application* has a very specific meaning. A web application is a technical construct, and each web application has its own databases associated with it. If you create two SharePoint *web applications*, they store their content and configuration information in different databases.   
[ **A simple word can have different meanings** ]   

* When I create a website using SharePoint, I have to select which type of template you want to use to create the site. Depending on the template we choose we get a specific number of features and functionalities included in the site.

* We can always add more features to the template we chose.
* We can also choose to start with an empty template. 

# The Team Site  

* The Team Site website template includes features such as a discussion board, library to store documents, and a calendar.
* It's one of the most common templates on Sharepoint.
