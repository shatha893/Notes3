# Easy Phish

* At first I start it researching phishing and how the hell is it related to OSINTing. 
* Turns out there are a bunch of tools online that can help me with domain osinting.
* So while osinting the domain doing a `dig` but online through a website I found that there's something called "spf" and that it's used to protect the company's domain from letting anyone using there domain as they wish. It kind of restricts who can send with this email.  
* So the idea was, why did "secure-startup.com"'s customers get alot of phishing emails? Because whoever likes can send an email with their domain claiming that they're legit when they're not.
* How can they send with a specific domain? Not sure I have to research it.



## Research Just to Understand
* SPF?

* How can we send an email with a domain like "secure-startup.com" if the company allows me (unintentionally) like how in this situation?
