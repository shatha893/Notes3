# Infiltration  

* It was super easy.
* The moment I found the account of the employee (Don't remember her name) I looked through her instagram account and found a picture that had her badge in it.
* The point of the challenge?
  * Probably that it's a bad idea to take a picture of your God damn badge because it might reveal some information that someone with a twisted mind might exploit it.
