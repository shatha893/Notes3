# Missing In Action  

* Found a blog for the guy "Roland Sanchez" and found that his bank made a tour around england in multiple locations the blog provides the locations and the dates.
* The guy's post on the blog was dated February the first so the tour came after this post that he stated in that he will be going on a business trip.
* The bank seems fishy. I don't know if that's because the bank is fake and the ones who made the challenge are playing around or that the bank have something to do with the kidnapping.

* Tools whatismyname.
* Found a flag in a website for a cafe in Liverpool but it's not WORKING!!!  HTB{Y0u_aR3_th3_grat3st}
* Turns out it's not the flag. The flag is on another website for another restuarant and the name is correct there. The difference was that the name with the first flag that I found was "Ronald" when the guy's real name is "Roland". 

* What is the point of the challenge?  
  * Maybe to just train on searching information about a person.
  * I'll check a writeup on the challenge.
  * So writeups seems to just solve the challenge in a way that is not so different from the approach I took. So they're kind of USELESS. Anyway, it's always nice to read how other people solve challenges.
