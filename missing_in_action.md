# Missing In Action  

* Found a blog for the guy "Roland Sanchez" and found that his bank made a tour around england in multiple locations the blog provides the locations and the dates.
* The guy's post on the blog was dated February the first so the tour came after this post that he stated in that he will be going on a business trip.
* The bank seems fishy. I don't know if that's because the bank is fake and the ones who made the challenge are playing around or that the bank have something to do with the kidnapping.

* Tools whatismyname.
* Found a flag in a website for a cafe in Liverpool but it's not WORKING!!!  HTB{Y0u_aR3_th3_grat3st}
